<h3><span>ON THE <a id="PROPOSED"></a>PROPOSED RECORD OF EXISTING MONUMENTS.</span></h3>


<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page417"></a>[417]</span> Although disappointed in the hope we had entertained of being, by this
time, in a position to announce that some decided steps had been taken
to carry out, in a practical manner, the great scheme of preserving a
record of our existing Monuments, we are gratified at being enabled to
bring under the notice of our readers several communications which show
the still increasing interest which is felt upon the subject.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> The first, by Sir Thomas Phillipps, besides some valuable
information upon the matter immediately under consideration, contains
several very useful suggestions upon other, though kindred points.</p>


<p>In approving of the design mentioned in your "Notes" by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. D<span class="smcap lowercase">UNKIN</span>,
 it has surprised me that in no one of the communications which you
 have there printed is any allusion to the multitude of inscriptions
  already collected, and now preserved in the British Museum and
  other libraries. A list of what are already copied should <i>first</i>
  be made, which would considerably abridge the labour of collecting.
 For instance, the whole of Gloucestershire has been preserved by
  Bigland, and nearly two-thirds of these have been printed. I should
  recommend his plan to be adopted, being <i>multum in parvo</i>, as to
   the headstones in the churchyards, and the clearest for reference
     by its alphabetical order of parishes. He copies them about 1780;
     so that now seventy years remain to be obtained. His collection
     would make two, or at most three, volumes folio, by which we can
     form an approximate idea as to the extent for the kingdom, which I
     estimate at one hundred volumes for the forty counties, because
     some of these are very small, and many monuments have been
     destroyed by the barbarous Gothlike conduct of church renovators
     and builders. (<i>A propos</i> of which conduct, I believe they are
     liable to an <i>action at law</i> from the next of kin: at all events,
     it is sacrilege.) In many county histories, <i>all</i> the monuments
     inside the churches, up to nearly the date of the publication, have
     been printed, as in Nichols's <i>Leicestershire</i>. I have myself
     printed the greater part of those for Wiltshire; but some are
     incorrectly printed, not having been collated; for I merely printed
     a few as handbooks to accompany me in my personal correcting survey
     of each church at another time. I have also printed as far as
     letter "E" of Antony à Wood's and Hinton's <i>Oxfordshire Monuments</i>,
     of which, I believe, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. D<span class="smcap lowercase">UNKIN</span> has a MS. copy. Now, it would be
     useless to reprint those which have been printed; consequently I
     should imagine twenty-five or thirty volumes, on Bigland's plan,
     would comprise all the villages; and I should imagine five or ten
     volumes at<span class="pagenum" id="page418">[418]</span> most would comprise all the capital towns. Allow
     me here to suggest the absolute necessity of taking "Notes" of the
     residence, parentage, and kindred of <i>every one</i> of the families of
     that vast tide of emigration now quitting our shores; and I call
     Lord Ashley's and Mr. Sidney Herbert's attention to it. These poor
     people will, many of them, become rich in half a century; will then
     probably die without a kindred soul in America to possess their
     wealth; and their next of kin must be sought for in the mother
     land, where, unless some <i>registered memorial</i> of their departure
     and connexions is kept, all traces of their origin may be lost for
     ever. It was the neglect of an act like this which has involved the
     beginning of nations in such profound obscurity. It was the neglect
     of such a register as I here propose, that makes it so difficult
     now for the American to discover the link which actually connected
     him with England. There is a corporate body, long established in
     this country, whose sole occupation is to make such registers; but
     at present they confine themselves to those called gentlemen. Why
     not make them useful as registers of the poor, at a small
     remuneration for entering each family. These poor, or their
     descendants, will some day become gentlemen, and perhaps not
     ashamed of their ancestry, although they may derive it through
     poverty. How gratified they may feel to be able, by means of this
     proposed registry, clearly to trace themselves to Great Britain
     (once the mistress of half the world), when their now adopted
 country has risen up in her place, and the mother has become
 subject to the daughter.</p>

<p>  And then, too, how valuable will Americans and Canadians,
 Australians and New Zealanders, find the proposed <i>Monumentarium</i>
 of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. D<span class="smcap lowercase">UNKIN</span>.</p>


     <div class="boxsig"><p> T<span class="smcap lowercase">HOS</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">HILLIPPS</span>.<br />
      Middle Hill, April, 1851.</p></div>

<p class="blockquot">The next is from a frequent contributor to our pages, and we have
   selected it for publication from among many which we have received
   promising assistance in the carrying out of the great scheme, because it
   shows very strikingly how many of the memorials, which it is the
   especial object of that scheme to preserve, have disappeared within the
   last few years.</p>


    <p> Your valuable remarks on this head have induced me to send you a
  few observations in the same direction. You have justly said that
  the means by which the object can be accomplished fall into the
 three distinct operations of Collection, Preservation, and
 Publication. The first will require the help of all antiquaries
 throughout the kingdom who will volunteer their services, and of
 the clergymen resident in country parishes. Where possible, it
 would be well to find a co-operator in every county town, who would
  undertake the collection of all ancient memorials in his own
  district, either by personal inspection, or by the aid of the
  clergy. For this county we have, fortunately, a record of
     all or most of the monuments existing in the time of James I.,
     published in Burton's History. Besides the monuments, there are
     also mentioned the coats of arms preserved in the churches. In the
     useful and voluminous world of Nichols, the record is brought down
     nearly to the commencement of the present century. But in late
     years, many ancient memorials have been removed altogether, or
     displaced. A day or two ago, I found only one monument in a village
     church, where Burton says there were two in his time. The chancel
     of St. Martin's Church, Leicester, a few years ago, contained a
     large number, of which many have been placed elsewhere, in order to
     "improve" the appearance of this part of the edifice. I believe a
 list of the monuments is preserved somewhere. This kind of
  proceeding has been carried on very generally throughout the
 country since the desire for "church restoration" has prevailed,
  and has led to great alterations in the interiors of our old parish
churches. I should be happy to lend a helping hand in the
  collections for Leicester and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p> The former of these books (<i>Epitaphs</i>, &amp;c.) is perhaps of no great

<p><i>The Star Min Al Auwâ.</i></p>
<p>"Adam Scrivener, if ever it thee befall</p>
<p>Boece, or Troilus, for to write newe,</p>
<p>Under thy long locks thou mayst have the scull</p>
<p> But, after my making, thou write more trew;</p>

<p>And all thorow thy negligence and rape."</p>
<p class="author"> <i><small>Chaucer to his own Scrivener</small>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If, during his own lifetime, and under his own eye, poor Chaucer was so
sinned against as to provoke this humorous malediction upon the head of
the delinquent, it cannot be a matter of surprise that, in the various
hands his text has since passed through, many expressions should have
been perverted, and certain passages wholly misunderstood. And when we
find men, of excellent judgment in other respects, proposing, as
Tyrwhitt did, to alter Chaucer's words to suit their own imperfect
comprehension of his meaning, it is only reasonable to suspect that
similar mistakes may have induced early transcribers to alter the text,
wherever, to their wisdom, it may have seemed expedient.</p>

<p>Now I know of no passage more likely to have been tampered with in this
way, than those lines of the prologue to the <i>Persone's Tale</i>, alluded
to at the close of my last communication. Because, supposing (which I
shall afterwards endeavour to prove) that Chaucer really meant to write
something to this effect: "Thereupon, as we were entering a town, the
moon's rising, with Min al auwâ in Libra, began to ascend (or to become
visible),"&mdash;and supposing that his mode of expressing this had been,</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p>"Therewith the mone's exaltacioun,</p>
<p> In libra men alawai gan ascende,</p>
 <p> As we were entrying at a towne's end:"</p></div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;in such a case, what can be more probable than that some ignorant
transcriber, never perhaps dreaming of such a thing as the Arabic name
of a star, would endeavour <i>to make sense</i> of these, to him, obscure
words, by converting them into English. The process of transition would
be easy; "min" or "men" requires little violence to become "mene" (the
modern "mean" with its many significations), and "al auwâ" (or "alwai,"
as Chaucer would probably write it) is equally identical with "alway."
The misplacement of "Libra" might then follow as a seeming necessity;
and thus the line would assume its present form, leaving the reader to
understand it, either with Urry, as,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p> "I mene Libra, that is, I <i>refer to</i> Libra;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or with Tyrwhitt:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p> "In mene Libra, that is, In <i>the middle of</i> Libra."</p>
</div>

<p>Now, to Urry's reading, it may be objected that it makes <i>the thing
ascending</i> to be Libra, and does not of necessity imply the moon's
appearance above the horizon. But since the rising of the moon is a
<i>visible</i> phenomenon, while that of Libra is theoretical, it must have
been <i>to the former</i> Chaucer was alluding, as to something witnessed by
the whole party as they</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Were entrying at a towne's end;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or otherwise this latter observation would have no meaning.</p>

<p>The objection to Tyrwhitt's reading is of a more technical nature&mdash;the
moon, if in <i>the middle</i> of Libra, <i>could not</i> be above the horizon, in
the neighbourhood of Canterbury, at four o'clock P. M., in the month of
April. Tyrwhitt, it is true, would probably smooth away the difficulty
by charging it as another inconsistency against his author; but I&mdash;and I
hope by this time such readers of
as are interested
in the subject&mdash;have seen too many proofs of Chaucer's competency in
matters of science, and of his commentator's incompetency, to feel
disposed to concede to the latter such a convenient method of
interpretation.</p>

<p>But there is a third objection common to both readings&mdash;that they do not
satisfactorily account for the word "alway;" for although Tyrwhitt
endeavours to explain it by <i>continually</i>, "was <i>continually</i>
ascending," such a phrase is by no means intelligible when applied to a
single observation.</p>

<p>For myself, I can say that this word "alway" was, from the first, the
great difficulty with me&mdash;and the more I became convinced of the studied
meaning with which Chaucer chose his other expressions, the less
satisfied I was with this; and the<span class="pagenum" id="page420">[420]</span> more convinced I felt that the
whole line had been corrupted.</p>

<p>In advocating the restoration of the reading which I have already
suggested as the original meaning of Chaucer, I shall begin by
establishing the <i>probability</i> of his having intended to mark the moon's
place by associating her rising with that of a known fixed star&mdash;a
method of noting phenomena frequently resorted to in ancient astronomy.
For that purpose I shall point out another instance wherein Chaucer
evidently intended an application of the same method for the purpose of
indicating a particular position of the heavens; but first it must
noted, that in alluding to the Zodiac, he always refers <i>to the signs</i>,
never to the constellations&mdash;in fact, he does not appear to recognise
the latter at all! Thus, in that palpable allusion to the precession of
the equinoxes, in the Frankeleine's Tale&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
<p> "He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove</p>
<p>From the hed of thilke fixe Aries above:"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;by <i>the hed of Aries</i>, Chaucer did not mean the os frontis of the Ram,
whereon Alnath still shines conspicuously, but the equinoctial point,
from which Alnath <i>was shove</i> by the extent of a whole sign.</p>

<p>This being premised, I return to the indication of a point in the
ecliptic by the coincident rising of a star; and I contend that such was
plainly Chaucer's intention in those lines of the Squire's Tale wherein
King Cambuscan is described as rising from the feast:&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
<p>"Phebus hath left the angle meridional,</p>
<p>And yet ascending was the beste real,</p>
<p> The gentle Leon, <i>with his Aldryan</i>."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which means that <i>the sign</i> Leo was then in the horizon&mdash;the precise
degree being marked by the coincident rising of the star Aldryan.</p>

<p>Speght's explanation of "Aldryan," in which he has been copied by Urry
and Tyrwhitt, is&mdash;"a star in the neck of the Lion." What particular star
he may have meant by this, does not appear; nor am I at present within
reach of probable sources wherein his authority, if he had any, might be
searched for and examined; but I have learned to feel such confidence in
Chaucer's significance of description, that I have no hesitation in
assuming, until authority for a contrary inference shall be produced,
that by the star "Aldryan" he meant REGULUS, not the neck, but the
heart, of the Lion&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Because it is the most remarkable star in the sign Leo.</p>

<p>2nd. Because it was, in Chaucer's time, as it now is, nearly upon the
line of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>3rd. Because its situation in longitude, about two-thirds in the sign
Leo, just tallies with Chaucer's expression "<i>yet</i> ascending,"&mdash;that is,
one-third of the sign was still below the horizon.</p>

<p>Let us examine how this interpretation consists with the other
circumstances of the description. The feste-day of this Cambuscan was
"The last idus of March"&mdash;that is, the 15th of March&mdash;"after the
yere"&mdash;that is, after the <i>equinoctial year</i>, which had ended three or
four days previously. Hence the sun was in three degrees of
Aries&mdash;confirmed in Canace's expedition on the following morning, when
he was "in the Ram foure degrees yronne," and his corresponding right
ascension was twelve minutes. Now by "the angle meridional" was meant
the two hours <i>inequall</i> immediately succeeding noon (or while the "1st
House" of the sun was passing the meridian), and these two hours may, so
near the equinox, be taken as ordinary hours. Therefore, when "Phebus
hath left the angle meridional," it was two o'clock P.M., or eight hours
after sunrise, which, added to twelve minutes, produces eight hours
twelve minutes as the ascending point of the equinoctial. The ascending
point of <i>the ecliptic</i> would consequently be twenty degrees in Leo, or
within less than a degree of the actual place of the star Regulus, which
in point of fact did rise on the 15th of March, in Chaucer's time,
almost exactly at two in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Such coincidences as these could not result from mere accident; and,
whatever may have been Speght's authority for the location of Aldryan, I
shall never believe that Chaucer would refer to an inferior star when
the great "Stella Regia" itself was in so remarkable a position for his
purpose&mdash;assuming always, as a matter of course, that he referred his
phenomena, not to the country or age wherein he laid the action of his
tale, but to his own.</p>

<p>This, then, is the precedent by which I support the similar, and rather
startling, interpretation I propose of these obscure words "In mena
Libra alway."</p>

<p>There are two twin stars, of the same magnitude, and not far apart, each
of which bears the Arabic title of Min al auwâ; one (<ins title='Greek: beta'>&#946;</ins> Virginis) in the
 sign Virgo&mdash;the other (<ins title='Greek: delta'>&#948;</ins> Virginis) in that of Libra.</p>

<p>The latter, in the south of England, in Chaucer's time, would rise a few
minutes before the autumnal equinoctial point, and might be called
<i>Libra</i> Min al auwâ either from that circumstance, or to distinguish it
from its namesake in Virgo.</p>

<p>Now on the 18th of April this Libra Min al auwâ would rise in the
neighbourhood of Canterbury at about half-past three in the afternoon,
so that by four o'clock it would attain an altitude of about five
degrees&mdash;not more than sufficient to render the moon, supposing it to
have risen with the star, visible (by daylight) to the pilgrims
"entrying at a towne's end."</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that the only year, perhaps in the whole of
Chaucer's lifetime, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="page421">[421]</span>
 moon could have arisen with this
star on the 18th of April, should be the identical year to which
Tyrwhitt, <i>reasoning from historical evidence alone</i>, would fain
attribute the writing of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. (Vide Introductory
Discourse, note 3.)</p>

<p>On the 18th of April, 1388, Libra Min al auwâ, and the moon, rose
together about half-past three P. M. in the neighbourhood of Canterbury;
and Tyrwhitt, alluding to the writing of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, "<i>could
hardly suppose it was much advanced before 1389!</i>"</p>

<p>Such a coincidence is more than remarkable&mdash;it is convincing: especially
when we add to it that 1388 "is the very date that, by a slight and
probable injury to the last figure, might become the <i>traditional</i> one
of 1383!"</p>

<p>Should my view, therefore, of the true reading of this passage in
Chaucer be correct, it becomes of infinitely greater interest and
importance than a mere literal emendation, because it supplies that
which has always been supposed wanting to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, viz.,
some means of identifying the year to which their action ought to be
attributed. Hitherto, so unlikely has it appeared that Chaucer, who so
amply furnishes materials for the minor branches of the date, should
leave the year unnoted, that it has been accounted for in the
supposition that he reserved it for the unfinished portion of his
performance. But if we consider the ingenious though somewhat tortuous
methods resorted to by him to convey some of the other data, it is by no
means improbable that he might really have devised this circumstance of
the moon's rising as a means of at least <i>corroborating</i> a date that he
might intend to record afterwards in more direct terms.</p>

     <div class="boxsig"><p> A. E. B.</p></div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the foregoing I have obtained, through the kindness
of Mr. Thoms, the several readings of the lines commented upon in six
different MSS. in the British Museum. And I have great satisfaction in
finding that five out of the six confirm my hypothesis, at least with
respect to the uncertain spelling of "alway." The readings in respect of
the two words are these:</p>

   <div class="poem">
<p> I meene   alweye.</p>
<p> In mena   alway.</p>
<p> I mene    allweye.</p>
<p> In mene   allwey.</p>
<p> I mene    alweie.</p>
<p> I mene    alwaye.</p>
</div>

<p>I acknowledge that, from the first, if I could have discovered a
probable interpretation of "mene" as an independent word, I should have
preferred it rather than that of making it a part of the Arabic name,
because I think that the star is sufficiently identified by the latter
portion of its name "Al auwâ," and because the preservation of "mene" in
its proper place in the line would afford a reading much less
forced than that I was obliged to have recourse to. Now it very
singularly happens that in "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span>  Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
of this day (page 388.) I
find, upon the authority of A. C. M., that there is an Armorican word
"menex" or "mene," signifying a summit or boundary. Here is an
accidental, though most probable, original of the Chaucerian "mene,"
because the moon's place in longitude at the time specified was
precisely on the verge or boundary of Libra: or even in the sense
"summit" the word would be by no means inappropriate to the point of a
sign in the ecliptic which first emerges from the horizon; with such a
reading the lines would stand thus, which is a very slight change from
<i>their present form</i>:</p>


     <div class="poem">
<p>"Then, with the mone's exaltacioun</p>
<p>In menez Libra, A<span class="smcap lowercase">LWAI</span> gan ascende,</p>
<p> As we were entrying at a towne's end."</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps A. C. M. would be good enough to cite his authorities for the
word "mene," "menez"&mdash;in the signification of "summit" or "margin"&mdash;with
examples, if possible, of its use in these or kindred senses.</p>

<p>And perhaps some Arabic scholar will explain the name "Min al auwâ," and
show in what way the absence of the prefix "Min" would affect it?</p>

have been made by your correspondents, showing that traditions may come
down from remote periods through very few links. Having myself seen a
man whose father lived in the time of Oliver Cromwell, I trust I shall
be excused for stating some particulars of this fact, which I think will
be considered by your readers as one of the most remarkable on record.
In the year 1844 died James Horrocks, a small farmer, who lived at
Harwood, a short distance from Bolton, in Lancashire, having completed
his hundredth year. This circumstance, however, was not so remarkable as
that of his own birth, his father, William Horrocks, having been born in
1657, one year before the death of Cromwell, and having married in 1741,
at the advanced age of eight-four, a second wife, a young and buxom
woman of twenty-six, by whom he had one child, the above James Horrocks,
born March 14, 1744, and baptized at Bradshaw Chapel, near Bolton.</p>

<p>It is believed that the first wife of William Horrocks had been employed
in the well-known family of the Chethams, at Castleton Hall, near
Rochdale (a branch of that of Humphrey Chetham), by whom they were both
much respected; and soon after the second marriage, he and his
youthful<span class="pagenum" id="page422">[422]</span> wife
 were sent for to Castleton Hall by the Chethams, by
whom they were treated with much kindness; and the remarkable disparity
of years in their marriage having no doubt created great interest, a
painter was employed to take their portraits, which are still in
existence, with the ages of the parties at the time, and the dates, when
taken, painted upon them.</p>

<p>I paid the son, James Horrocks, more than one visit, and on the last
occasion, in company with James Crossley, Esq., of Manchester, the
Reverend Canon Parkinson, Principal of St. Bees' College, and one or two
other gentlemen, I took my son with me. It happened to be the very day
on which he completed his hundredth year, and we found him full of
cheerfulness and content, expecting several of his descendants to spend
the day with him. I possess a portrait in crayons of this venerable
patriarch, taken on that day by a very clever artist, who accompanied us
on our visit, and which is an extremely faithful likeness of the
original. Should it please Providence to spare my son to attain to his
seventieth year, he also will be enabled, in the year 1900, to say that
he has seen a man whose father lived in the time of Oliver Cromwell;
thus connecting events, with the intervention of <i>one</i> life only,
comprehending a period of very nearly two centuries and a half.</p>

<p>P.S. A very interesting narrative of all the facts of this case was
published in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> a few years ago, comprising many
curious particulars not noticed by myself, a copy of which I shall be
glad to send you, if you think it worthy of insertion in

<h3><span>DR. <a id="YOUNG1"></a>YOUNG'S NARCISSA.</span></h3>

<p>A pamphlet was recently published at Lyons and Paris, by a Monsieur de
Terrebasse, intending to prove that the daughter-in-law of Dr. Young, so
pathetically lamented by him in the <i>Night Thoughts</i> under the poetical
name of "Narcissa," was not clandestinely buried at Montpellier; that
Dr. Young did not steal a grave for her from the Roman Catholics of that
city; and that consequently the celebrated and touching episode in Night
III. is purely imaginary. This opinion of M. de Terrebasse, first given
to the world by him in 1832, and now repeated, has been controverted by
the writer of an article in the <i>Gazette Médicale</i> of Montpellier. The
tomb, it is said, of Elisabeth Lee, Dr. Young's daughter-in-law, was
discovered a few years since at Lyons; and M. de Terrebasse endeavours
to prove, from that circumstance, and from a comparison of facts and
dates, that this Elisabeth Lee was the "Narcissa" of the poet.
Not having seen M. de Terrebasse's pamphlet, and being indebted to the
<i>Journal des Savants</i> for this brief account of it, it seems difficult
to discover from it how M. de Terrebasse can pretend so summarily to
invalidate the solemn and touching assertions of the poet, which
assuredly are anything but flights of fancy.</p>

     door, bearing his beloved daughter, wrapped up in a sheet, upon his
     shoulder. When he had laid her in this hole he sat down, and, as
     the man expressed it, 'rained tears.' It appears also, that some
     time previous to this event, expecting the catastrophe, he had been
     seen walking solitarily backward in this garden, as if to find the
     most solitary spot for his purpose."&mdash;See <i>Evang. Mag.</i>, Nov. 1797.</p>

<h3><span>ENGLISH POEMS BY CONSTANTINE HUYGHENS.</span></h3>

<p>It is probable that some of your friendly correspondents in Holland may
have it in their power to indicate where the English verses of
Constantine Huyghens are to be found which he refers to in his <i>Koren
Bloemen</i>, 2<span class="topnum">de</span> Deel, p. 528. ed. 1672, where he was given Dutch
translations with the following superscriptions: "Aen Joff<span class="topnum">w</span> Utricia
Ogle, uyt mijn Engelsh;" and "Aen Me-Vrouwe Stanhope, met mijn Heilige
dagen, uyt mijn Engelsh."</p>

<p>Huyghens appears to have had a thorough knowledge of our language, and
his very interesting volume contains translations of twenty of Dr.
Donne's poems, very ably rendered, considering the difficulty of the
task. He refers to this in his address to the reader, and says that an
illustrious Martyr [Charles I.] many years since had declared that he
could not have believed that any one could have successfully
accomplished it. Huyghens confesses that the Latinisms with which our
language abounds, had given him much to wrestle with; and that it was
difficult to express in pure Dutch such words as <i>ecstasy</i>, <i>atomy</i>,
<i>influence</i>, <i>legacy</i>, <i>alloy,</i> &amp;c. The first stanza of the song, "Go
and catch a falling Star," may perhaps be acceptable to some of your
readers, who may not readily have access to the book:</p>


          <div class="poem">
<p class="i3">"Gaet en vatt een Sterr in 't vallen,</p>
<p class="i3">Maeckt <a id="een1"></a>een' Wortel-mensch<span class="topnum"><a href="#fn1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></span> met kind,</p>
<p>Seght waer men al den tijd die nu verby is vindt,</p>
<p>En wie des Duyvels voet geklooft heeft in twee ballen:</p>
<p class="i3">Leert my Meereminnen hooren,</p>
<p class="i3">Leert my hoe ick 't boose booren,</p>
<p class="i3">Van den Nijd ontkommen moet,</p>
<p>En wat Wind voor-wind is voor een oprecht gemoed."</p>
</div>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#een1" class="label">[1]</a> Mandrake.</p>

<p>One more example of his translation, from the epigram on Sir Albertus
Morton, may be allowed, as it is short:</p>

   <div class="poem">
<p class="i3"> "She first deceased; he for a little tried</p>
<p class="i3"> To live without her; liked it not, and died."</p>
<br />
<p> "Sy stierf voor uyt: hy pooghd' haer een' wijl tijds te derven,</p>
<p>Maer had geen' sin daer in, en ging oock liggen sterven."</p>
</div>

<p>Considering the affinity of the languages, and the frequent and constant
intercourse with Holland, it<span class="pagenum" id="page424">[424]</span> is singular that we should have to
reproach ourselves with such almost total ignorance respecting the
literature of that country. With the exception of the slight sketch
given by Dr. Bowring of its poetical literature, an Englishman has no
work to which he can turn in his own language for information; and Dutch
books may be sought for in vain in London. The late Mr. Heber when in
Holland did not neglect its literature, and at the dispersion of his
library I procured a few valuable Dutch books; among others, the very
handsome volume which has given rise to this note. It contains much
interesting matter, and affords a most amiable picture of the mind of
its distinguished author, who lived to the very advanced age of
ninety-one. There is a speaking and living portrait of him prefixed,
from the beautiful graver of Blotelingk, and a view of his chateau of
Hofwyck, with detailed plans of his garden, &amp;c. He was secretary to
three successive princes of Nassau, accountant to the Prince of Orange,
and Lord of Zuylichem; and lived in habits of friendly intercourse with
almost all the distinguished men who flourished during his long and
prosperous life. His son is well known to the world of science as the
inventor of the pendulum.</p>

<p>Translations of three or four of Constantine Huyghens' poems are given
by Dr. Bowring in his <i>Batavian Anthology</i>. And the great Vondel
pronounces his volume to be&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">

<h3><span>THE <a id="REV1"></a>REV. MR. GAY.</span></h3>

<p>The very interesting notices which you have often given us of the truly
great and inestimable Locke, induce me to trouble you with an inquiry
relative to a philosophical writer, who followed in his school, I mean
the Rev. Mr. Gay, the author of the Dissertation prefixed to Bishop
Law's translation of King's <i>Origin of Evil</i>. It is sufficient evidence
of the importance of that Dissertation, that it put Hartley upon
considering and developing the principle of association, into which
principle he conceived, and endeavoured to prove, that all the phenomena
of reasoning and affection might be resolved, and of which Laplace
observes, that it constitutes the whole of what has yet been done in the
philosophy of the human mind; "la partie réelle de la métaphysique"
(<i>Essai Philosophique sur les Probabilités</i>, p. 224. ed. 1825).</p>

<p>Of this Mr. Gay, I have not yet been able to learn more than that he was
a clergyman in the West of England; but of what place, of what family,
where educated, of what manner of life, or what habits of study,
biographical or topographical reading has hitherto furnished me
with any information. I should feel greatly indebted to any of your
readers who would give the clue to what is known or can be known about
him. It is probably within easy reach, though I have missed it. The
ordinary biographical dictionaries make no mention of him.</p>

<p class="minor"><i>Supposed Inscription in St. Peter's Church, Rome.</i>&mdash;When at school in

inscription was to be found in some part of St. Peter's Church in Rome:</p>

    <div class="poem">
<p> "Nunquam amplius super hanc cathedram cantabit Gallus."</p>
</div>

<p>It appears that the active part taken by the French in fomenting the
great schism of the Church during the fourteenth century, when they set
up and maintained at Avignon a Pope of their own choosing, had generated
an abhorrence of French interference in the Italian mind; and that, when
the dissensions were abated by the suspension of the rival Popes, the
<i>ultramontane</i> cardinals had posted up this inscription to testify their
desire for the exclusion of French ecclesiastics from the Papal chair.
In one respect the prediction remains in force to this day; for I
believe I am correct in saying that no Frenchman has worn the triple
crown for the last 450 years. But that portion of it which is implied in
the second meaning of "Gallus," has been woefully belied in our time by
the forcible occupation of Rome by a French army, on which occasion the
Gallic cock had all the "crowing" to himself.</p>

<p>I have never had an opportunity of ascertaining the existence of this
inscription, and shall be obliged to any correspondent of

He then told me that each boy, on the Sunday but one preceding the
holidays, always tore a piece of his shirt or handkerchief off and wore
it in the button-hole of his jacket as his "rag." When a boy, I remember
being compelled to do the same when at school at Hailsham in Sussex, and

     as He that 'sett alle on seven,' <i>i. e.</i>, set or appointed
     everything in seven days. A similar phrase at p. 85. is not so
     evident. It is explained in the Glossary, 'to<span class="pagenum" id="page426">[426]</span> set things in,
     to put them in order;' but it evidently implies, in some cases, an
     exactly opposite meaning, to set in confusion, to rush to battle,
     as in the following examples. '<i>To set the steven</i>, to agree upon
     the time and place of meeting previous to some expedition,'&mdash;<i>West
     and Cumb. Dial.</i> p. 390. These phrases may be connected with each
     other. Be this as it may, hence is certainly derived the phrase <i>to

pastime, it might be pardoned; but he could not digest those wicked
swobbers;" and it was with some pains that my Lord Somers could
undeceive him. So says Swift, in his <i>Essay on the Fates of Clergymen</i>;
and a note in Sir W. Scott's edition (1824, vol. viii. p 231.) informs
us that the primate was "Tenison, who, by all contemporary accounts, was

composer had purposely denied the preliminary of an overture; a practice
now happily exploded, which seems to have had its origin in a
misinterpretation of the name; as though Handel had written the overture
to suit any <i>occasion</i> when one might be needed, instead of, as I am
rather disposed to believe, having some particular occasion in view for
which the oratorio was composed.</p>

     writers of a century ago, for "Occasional Sermons" or services, &amp;c.
     The question is simply one of fact. <i>Is</i> there an Oratorio?
     Everybody knows the overture. The writer of this note remembers

<h3><span>HUGH HOLLAND AND HIS WORKS.</span></h3>

<p>An accidental circumstance having led me to re-peruse the article
entitled <i>Hugh Holland and his works</i>
(<a title="Go to Vol. ii., p. 265." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13936/13936-h/13936-h.htm#page265">Vol. ii., p. 265.</a>),
 I feel myself
called on, as a lover of facts, to notice some of the statements which
it contains.</p>

<p>1. "He was born at Denbigh in 1558." He was born at Denbigh, but not in
1558. In 1625 he thus expressed himself:</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Why was the fatall spinster so vnthrifty?</p>
<p> To draw my third four yeares to tell and fifty!"</p></div>

<p>2. "In 1582 he matriculated at Baliol College, Oxford." He did not quit
Westminster School till 1589. If he ever pursued his studies at Baliol
College, it was some ten years afterwards.</p>

<p>3. "About 1590 he succeeded to a fellowship at Trinity College,
Cambridge." In 1589 he was elected from Westminster to a <i>scholarship</i>
in Trinity College, Cambridge&mdash;not to a <i>fellowship</i>. At a later
period of life, he may have succeeded to a fellowship.</p>

<p>4. "Holland published two works: 1. <i>Monumenta sepulchralia Sancti
Pauli</i>, London, 1613, 4to. 2. <i>A cypress garland</i> etc., London, 1625,
4to." Hugh Holland was not the compiler of the first-named work: the
initials H. H admit of another interpretation. This, however, is a very
pardonable oversight. I could give about twenty authorities for
ascribing the work to Hugh Holland.</p>

<p>5. The dates assigned to the <i>Monumenta Sancti Pauli</i> are "1613, 1616,
1618, and 1633." Here are three errors in as many lines. The <i>first</i>
edition is dated in 1614. The edition of 1633, which is entitled
<i>Ecclesia Sancti Pavli illvstrata</i>, is the <i>second</i>. No other editions
exist.</p>

<p>6. "Holland also printed a copy of Latin verses before Alexander's
<i>Roxana</i>, 1632." No such work exists. He may have printed verses before
the <i>Roxana</i> of W. Alabaster, who was his brother-collegian.</p>

<p>The authorities which I have consulted are Fuller, Anthony à Wood, Henry
Holland, son of the celebrated Philemon Holland, Hugh Holland, and
Joseph Welch; and in submitting the result of my researches to critical
examination, I must commend the writer of the article in question for
his continued efforts to produce new facts, and to explode current
errors.</p>

<p>Insensible as modern critics may be to the poetical merits of Hugh
Holland, we find him described by Camden as one of the <i>most pregnant
wits</i> of those times; and he certainly gave a notable proof of his
wit&mdash;for fame is that which <i>all hunt after</i>&mdash;in contributing some lines
to <i>Mr. William Shakespeares comedies, histories, and tragedies</i>.</p>

<p>On that account, if on no other, the particulars of his life should be
inquired into and recorded. His <i>Cypress garland</i>, a copy of which I
possess, is rich in autobiographical anecdote; and I have collected some
of his fugitive verses, a specimen of which may amuse. As one of the
shortest, I transcribe the lines which he addressed to Giles Farnaby, a
musical composer of some eminence, on the publication of his <i>Canzonets
to fowre voyces</i>, A. D. 1598.</p>


     <div class="poem">

<h3><span>THE <a id="MILESIANS1"></a>MILESIANS.</span></h3>
<p class="center3">
(<a title="Go to Vol. iii., p. 353." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26899/26899-h/26899-h.htm#page353">Vol. iii., p. 353.</a>)</p>

<p>In reply to W. R. M., who asks for information respecting the
round towers of Ireland, I beg to refer him to Dr. Petrie's essay on the
<i>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</i>, in which he will find a full
discussion of the origin, uses, and history of the round towers.</p>

<p>In reference to the Milesians and other early colonists of Ireland, he
will find the most authentic ancient traditions in the Irish version of
the <i>Historia Britonum of Nennius</i>, lately published by the Irish
Archæological Society of Dublin, with a translation and notes, by the
Rev. J. H. Todd, D.D. The same volume contains also some very curious
and valuable notes by the Hon. A. Herbert.</p>

<p>What W. R. M. says about the pronunciation of certain names of towns in
Ireland, as confirming the tradition of a Milesian colony from Spain, is
a complete mistake. The pronunciation of <i>gh</i> to which he alludes,
exists only amongst the English (or Anglicised natives) who are unable
to pronounce the guttural <i>ch</i> or <i>gh</i> of the Celtic Irish, and have
substituted for it the sound of <i>h</i>, or the sound of the Spanish <i>j</i>, to
which W. R. M. refers. Besides this, every philologist knows that the
present language of Spain had no existence at the period to which the
Milesian invasion of Ireland must be referred. It is true that on the
west coast of Ireland some families among the peasantry retain many of
the characteristic features of modern Spaniards; but this circumstance
is due to an intercourse with Spain of a much more recent date than the
Milesian invasion, and is therefore no evidence of that event. It is
well known that considerable trade with Spain was carried on at Galway
and other ports of western Connaught, two centuries ago, and that many
Spanish families settled in Ireland, or intermarried with the natives
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>To remove W. R. M.'s mistaken impression that Drogheda, Aghada, &amp;c., are
names of Spanish origin, it may be well to inform him, first, that the
<i>gh</i> in such names is not sounded like the Spanish <i>j</i>, except, as I
have said, by&mdash;(I was on the point of writing <i>foreigners</i>), but I mean
by those who are unable to pronounce our Celtic guttural aspirates.
Secondly, that Drogheda, Aghada, &amp;c., are names significant in the Irish
language and perfectly well understood, and that as now written they are
not seen in their correct orthography, but in an Anglicised spelling
intended to represent to English ears the native pronunciation. In the
last century Drogheda was usually written <i>Tredagh</i> in English; but the
word in its proper spelling is <i>Droichet-atha</i>, the bridge of the ford,
<i>trajectum vadi</i>. There are many places in Ireland named from this word
<i>Droichet</i>, which is no doubt the Latin <i>trajectum</i>, the same which
forms a part of the name of <i>Utrecht</i> (Ultrajectum), and other
towns on the continent.</p>

<p>The word <i>Agha</i>, properly <i>Achadh</i>, signifies a <i>field</i>, and enters into
the composition of hundreds of topographical names in Ireland. But in
every case the <i>gh</i> (or <i>ch</i>, as it properly is) is pronounced
gutturally by the peasantry; the <i>h</i> or Spanish <i>j</i> sound is a modern
Anglicised corruption.</p>

<p>On the subject of Irish proper names of places and persons a vast body
of curious and valuable information will be found in the publications of
the Irish Archæological Society, and also in O'Donovan's splendid
edition of the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>.</p>

     <div class="boxsig"><p> H<span class="smcap lowercase">IBERNICUS</span>.</p></div>



<p>We <i>mere Irish</i> assume to be descended from a Ph&oelig;nician colony; the
word <i>Milesian</i> is not Irish, the families so designated being known in
the Irish language only as "Clonna Gäel" (I spare the English reader the
<i>mute</i> consonants, which <i>would rather bother him</i> to get his tongue
round).</p>

<p>Our tradition is, that the leader of the said colony saw Ireland from a
tower, still said to exist near Corunna; he bore the style of <i>Mileadle
Spaniogle</i>, for which no better translation is offered than "the soldier
of Spain." His brothers and sons, the chief himself having deceased, are
said to have conducted the expedition to Ireland; and if your
correspondent wishes for a full account of their adventures, he should
consult Keating's <i>History of Ireland</i>, which will, at all events,
afford him some amusement.</p>

<p>As to the round towers, Mr. Petrie's book on <i>The Ecclesiastical
Antiquities or Architecture of Ireland</i> has set that question at rest.
He has shown that they are undoubtedly Christian buildings intended as
<i>Bell-houses</i>, which their name in Irish signifies; and further,
probably, for the safe keeping of the sacred vessels, &amp;c., in time of
war or tumult. It is unfortunately too certain that agitation was always
rife in Ireland. On all points connected with Irish antiquities, the
safest and best reference is to the Secretary of the Royal Irish
Academy, Dublin. If this answer attract any of your correspondents to
visit the museum of that establishment, I venture to prophecy that they
will account themselves well repaid for their trouble, even though they
should miss visiting the Great Exhibition thereby.</p>

<p>I remember hearing a worthy citizen of Norwich remark, that it was very
odd there should be three churches in the city called after saints whose
names began with the letter T. Having been myself resident in that city
many years, without<span class="pagenum" id="page429">[429]</span> being aware of this fact, I took the liberty
of inquiring to which three he alluded; when I was unhesitatingly told,
"Why, Sain Tandrew's, Sain Taustin's, and Sain Tedmund's, to be sure!"
Let me then be allowed to repeat A<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span>'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> question, and to ask, "Why not
Tanthony for Saint Anthony?"</p>

<p>The same worthy citizen was once sheriff of Norwich, and, as is, or
haply was, the custom,&mdash;for I know not how these matters are managed
now-a-days,&mdash;went forth in civic state to meet the judges of assize.
When their lordships were seated in the sheriff's carriage, one of them
charitably observed, "Yours, I believe, is a very ancient city, Mr.
Sheriff!" to which the latter, a little flurried, no doubt, at being
thus so pointedly addressed, but in decided accents, replied, "It <i>was</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">ONCE</span>, my Lord!" And without stopping to consider what was passing in his
mind when he gave utterance to these somewhat ambiguous words, may we
not take them up, and ask whether it be not even so, not only as regards
Norwich, but most of her venerable sister towns as well? Where are their
quondam glories&mdash;their arts and rare inventions&mdash;their "thoughts in
antique words conveyed"&mdash;their "boast of heraldry"&mdash;their pageantries
and shows? Where their high-peaked gables&mdash;their curiously wrought eaves
and overhanging galleries&mdash;their quaint doorways, so elaborately carved,
and all their other cunning devices?&mdash;"Modern Taste," with finger
pointed to the newest creation of her plaster genius, triumphantly
echoes the monosyllable, and answers, "Where?" Well, we are perforce
content; only with this proviso:&mdash;if, fatigued with the tinselled
superficialities and glossy refinements of the present, we are fain to
"cast one longing lingering look behind," and chance to light upon some
worthy illustrative memorial of the literature, the manners, or domestic
life of the past,&mdash;that the spirit of Captain Cuttle's sage advice be
made our own, and that we forthwith transfer our prize for the critical
examination of "diving antiquaries" to the conservative pages of
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>".</p>

     <div class="boxsig"> <p>C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>.</p></div>



<p><i>The Tanthony.</i>&mdash;Will your correspondent A<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> permit one to refer him to
an authority for the use of the word "Tanton" for St. Anthony? An
hospital in York, dedicated to St. Anthony, after the dissolution came
into the possession of a gild or fraternity of a master and eight
keepers, who were commonly called "Tanton Pigs." Vide Drake's
<i>Eboracum</i>, p. 315.</p>


     <div class="boxsig"><p> <ins title='Greek: D'>&#916;</ins>.</p></div>



<p><i>Tanthony Bell at Kimbolton.</i>&mdash;"Tanthony" is from St. Anthony. In
Hampshire the small pig of the litter (in Essex called "the cad") is, or
once was, called "the Tanthony pig." Pigs were especially under this
saint's care. The ensign of the order of St. Anthony of Hainault was a
collar of gold made like a hermit's girdle; at the centre thereof
hung a crutch and a small bell of gold. St. Anthony is styled, among his
numerous titles, "Membrorum restitutor," and "Dæmonis fugator:" hence
the bell.</p>


     <p class="blockquot">"The Egyptians have none but wooden bells, except one brought by
     the Franks into the monastery of St. Anthony."&mdash;Rees' <i>Cyclopædia</i>,
     art. Bell.</p>

<p>I hope A<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> will be satisfied with this connexion of St. Anthony with
the pig, the crutch, and the bell.</p>

<p>"The staff" in the figure of the saint at Merthyr is, I should think, a
crutch.</p>


     <p class="blockquot">"The custom of making particular saints tutelars and protectors of
     one or another species of cattle is still kept up in Spain and
     other places. They pray to the tutelar when the beast is sick. Thus
     St. Anthony is for hogs, and we call a poor starved creature a
     <i>Tantony</i> pig."&mdash;Salmon's <i>History of Hertfordshire</i>, 1728.</p>


   <div class="boxsig"> <p>  A. H<span class="smcap lowercase">OLT</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">HITE</span>.</p></div>


<p>May I venture to observe, in confirmation of A<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span>'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> suggestion as to the
origin of this term, that the bell appears to have been a constant
attribute of St. Anthony, although I have tried in vain to discover any
allusion to it in his legend?</p>

<p>Frederick von Schlegel, in describing a famous picture by Bramante
d'Urbino (<i>Æsthetic and Miscellaneous Works</i>, p. 78.), mentions St.
Anthony as "carrying the hermit's little bell;" and Lord Lindsay, in the
Introduction to his <i>Letters on Christian Art</i> (vol. i. p. 192.), says
that St. Anthony is known by "the bell and staff, denoting mendicancy."
If this be the case, the bell at Kimbolton was doubtless intended
originally to announce the presence of some wayfarer or mendicant.
Tanthony is a common contraction for St. Anthony, as in the term "a
Tanthony pig;" and a similar system of contraction was in use amongst
the troubadours, who put <i>Na</i> for <i>Donna</i>; as <i>Nalombarda</i> for <i>Donna
Lombarda</i>.</p>

<p>The bell carried by St. Anthony is sometimes thought to have reference
to his Temptations; bells being, in the words of Durandus, "the trumpets
of the eternal king," on hearing which the devils "flee away, as through
fear." I think, however, that these words apply rather to church bells.</p>

<p>I think those of your readers who are interested in this Query will feel
that the replies it has received are not quite satisfactory, and I
therefore trust you will find some room for the following remarks.</p>

<p>I would beg to ask, can there be any doubt that from Southwark to
Dartford, and from Rochester to their destination, Chaucer and his
fellow pilgrims journeyed along the old Roman way, then for many
centuries the great thoroughfare from<span class="pagenum" id="page430">[430]</span> London to the south-eastern
coast, and which for these portions of the route is nearly identical
with the present turnpike-road? The <i>Tales</i> themselves make it certain
that the pilgrims started on this ancient way; for when the Host
interrupts the sermonising of the Reeve, he mentions Deptford and
Greenwich as being in their route:</p>

      <div class="poem">
<p>"Say forth thy tale, and tarry not the time,</p>
<p>Lo Depeford, and it is half way prime;</p>
<p>Lo Greenewich, there many a shrew is in,</p>
<p>It were all time thy tale to begin."</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after leaving Dartford the turnpike-road bends to the left,
reaching Rochester by Gravesend and Gadshill; whilst the Roman way,
parts of which are still used, was carried to that city by Southfleet,
and through Cobham Park; and it seems to me that the only question we
have to solve is, whether Chaucer followed the Roman way throughout, or
whether between Dartford and Rochester he took the course of what is now
the turnpike-road. For I cannot but think it very unlikely that, with a
celebrated road leading almost straight as a line to Canterbury, the
pilgrims should either go many miles out of their way to seek another,
as they must have done, or run the risk of losing themselves in a
"horse-track."</p>

<p>In attempting to determine this point, your readers will remember the
injunction of Poins:</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> "But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning by four o'clock early at
     Gadshill; there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich
     offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses."&mdash;<i>Henry
     IV.</i>, Pt. I. Act I. Sc. 2.</p>

<p class="noindent">And Gadshill the robber tells his fellows:</p>

     <p class="blockquot">"There's money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going to
     the king's exchequer."&mdash;Act II. Sc. 2.</p>

<p>Here we learn, not only that in Shakspeare's time the road between
London and Canterbury was by Gadshill, but also that the tradition was
that the pilgrims had been accustomed to travel that road. We cannot, I
think, be far out of the way in concluding this to have been the road
that Chaucer selected, and thus have the satisfaction of connecting with
it in an immediate and especial manner the two greatest names in our
literature; for, if he meant the only other road that seems at all
likely, he would, near Cobham, pass within two miles of this famed hill.
Nor can there be much doubt that so loyal a company, following a pious
custom, would tarry at Rochester, to make their offerings on the shrine
of St. William; if so, among the many thousands who have trodden the
steps, now well-nigh worn away, leading to its site, is there one
individual whose presence here we can recall with more pleasure than
that of the father of English poetry?</p>

<p>It is evident that the road mentioned by S. H.
(<a title="Go to Vol. ii., p. 237." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13427/13427-h/13427-h.htm#page237">Vol. ii., p. 237.</a>) is
not Chaucer's road; but I can well understand why it should be called
the "Pilgrims' Road;"  nor should I be surprised to learn that
other roads in Kent are known by the same name, for Chaucer tells us in
the "Prologue" to the <i>Tales</i> that</p>

                      <div class="poem">
<p class="i9">"From every shire's end</p>
<p class="i4">Of Engle-land to Canterbury they wend:"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and I need scarcely say that these widely scattered pilgrims would not
all traverse the country by one and the same road, but that they would
select various routes, according to the different localities from which
they came. Hence, several roads might be called "Pilgrims' Roads."</p>

<p>From a paper which appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i> in 1842, and has since
been reprinted in a separate form, the writer of which I take to be
identical with the reviewer of Buckler's work referred to by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
J<span class="smcap lowercase">ACKSON</span>, I think we may gather that what he speaks of as the "Old
Pilgrims' Road" is the Otford Road noticed by S. H. and M. (2.) Messrs.
Buckler's tract mentions no wayside chapels in Kent.</p>

<p>It may not be uninteresting to add, that the author of <i>Cabinet Pictures
of English Life&mdash;Chaucer</i> has expressed his firm belief, the grounds for
which must be sought in his work, that the "Pilgrims' Room" of the
Tabard, now the Talbot, in Southwark, whence these memorable pilgrims
set forth, must be at least as old as Chaucer, and that the very gallery
exists along which Chaucer and the pilgrims walked.</p>

 (<a title="Go to Vol. iii., p. 348." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26899/26899-h/26899-h.htm#page348">Vol. iii., p. 348.</a>).&mdash;I knew <i>all</i>
the writers, some of them intimately; and I have no doubt of the general
accuracy of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. <span class="smcap lowercase">HAWKIN</span>'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> communication. The items marked B are the least
to be relied on. I do not think Mr. Hammond, then Canning's colleague as
Under-Secretary of State, wrote a line, certainly not of verse, though
he no doubt assisted his friend in compiling, and perhaps correcting;
good offices, which obtained him an honourable <i>niche</i> in the
counter-satire issued from Brooke's, and preserved from oblivion by
having been reprinted in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> to give more poignancy to
Canning's reply, "Bard of the borrowed lyre," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Latin verses "Ipsa mali Hortatrix" were the <i>sole</i> production of
Lord Wellesley, and he reprinted them a year or two before his death;
Mr. Frere had no share in them: but, on the other hand, Mr. Frere may
have been, and I think was, the author of the <i>translation</i>, "Parent of
countless crimes." Lord Wellesley certainly was not; for it was made
after he had sailed for India.</p>

<p>With regard to Mr. Wright's appropriation of particular passages of the
longer poems to different authors, it is obviously impossible that it
should be more than a vague conjecture. I <i>know</i> that both Canning and
Gifford professed <i>not</i> to be able to make any such distribution; but
both left on my mind the impression that Canning's share of the "New
Morality" was so very much the largest as to entitle him to be
considered its author. Ought not Canning's verses to be collected?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is hardly an answer to E<span class="smcap lowercase">FFIGIES</span> to tell him that the earliest
occurrence of this line, with which I am acquainted, is in a rebus
beneath the device of the Parisian printer, Felix Balligault, about the
year 1496. Thus:</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p>"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</p>
<p>Felici monumenta die felicia felix</p>
 <p>Pressit: et hæc vicii dant retinentve nihil."</p>
</div>

<p>The device is a fruit-tree, from which a shield is suspended inscribed
<i>felix</i>. Two apes are seated at the foot of the tree. The thought is,
however, common to the wise and the witty of every age. Menander has it
thus:&mdash;</p>

     <p class="blockquot">"During<span class="pagenum" id="page432">[432]</span> the following (12th) century Dionysius Bar Salibi
     occupied the (Jacobite) patriarchal throne, a man noted for piety
     and learning. He composed several works on theological subjects,
     among which we find a curious disquisition on bells, the invention
     of which he ascribes to Noah. He mentions that several histories
     record a command given to that patriarch to strike on the bell with
     a piece of wood three times a day, in order to summon the workmen
     to their labour while he was building the ark. And this he seems to
     consider the origin of church bells, an opinion which, indeed, is

following has not, I fear, <i>canonical</i> authority, nor is it of <i>remote</i>
antiquity, still, as they are not lines of yesterday, they may serve as
one Reply to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span>'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> late Query on <i>Chiming, tolling, and

<p>"To call the folk to church in time</p>
                                  <p class="i9"> We <i>chime</i>,</p>

<p>When we mourn a departed soul</p>
                                  <p class="i9">We <i>toll</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>I think it probable (though I have no direct proof of it) that the great
bell, or tenor, was always <span class="smcap lowercase">RUNG</span> when a sermon was to be <i>preached</i>,
which was not the case when there was to be only prayers. I believe it
is so at this day at St. Mary's, Oxford; it is very certain that the
great bell, being so rung, is in some places called the <i>Sermon</i> Bell,
though I remember two legends on tenor bells, which seem to imply that
they were intended to call to prayers, viz.:&mdash;</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p>"Come when I call,</p>
<p>To serve God all."</p>
<br />
<p>"For Christ, his flock, I aloud do call,</p>
<p>To confess their sins, and be pardoned all."</p>
</div>

<p>The difference between ringing the tenor (or any bell for prayers), and
ringing it as a knell, is, that in the latter case the bell is set at
every pull or stroke, which causes a solemnity in the sound very
different from that produced by the very reverse mode of ringing it. Oh!
what language there is in bells. In <i>ringing</i>, the bell is swung round;
in <i>tolling</i>, it is swung merely sufficiently for the clapper to strike
the side. <i>Chiming</i> is when more bells than one are <i>tolled</i> in harmony;
if this be correct, to <i>toll</i> can be applied only when <i>one</i> bell is
sounded, and Horne Tooke's definition of the word, from <i>tollere</i>, to
<i>raise up</i>, must be wrong (humiliter loquor).</p>

<p>With regard to the present use of the old Sanctus Bell, which is called
at Ecclesfield <i>Tom Tinkler</i>, the same is often called the <i>Ting Tang</i>.</p>

the inquiries of the reviewer in the <i>Athenæum</i> of May 17, and your
correspondent, the writer of the <i>Extraordinary North Briton</i> appears to
have been an individual of the name of William Moore, not, as apparently
supposed, the poet William Mason. I have, amongst a complete series of
the London newspapers of the day, a set of the <i>Extraordinary North
Briton</i>, beginning Tuesday (May 10, 1768) and terminating with the 91st
No. (Saturday, January 27, 1770). Whether it was continued further I do
not know. The early numbers are published by Staples Steare, 93. Fleet
Street, and the subsequent ones by T. Peat, 22. Fleet Street, and by
William Moore, 55., opposite Hatton Garden, Holborn. The second and
subsequent numbers are entitled, <i>The Extraordinary North Briton</i>, by
W&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;. In the last three numbers the W&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash; is altered to
William Moore, and at the end of each is "London, printed and sold by
the author, W. Moore, No. 22., near St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street."
In the 90th number is the following advertisement:</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> "Mr. Moore thinks it highly incumbent on him to acquaint the
     public, that Thomas Brayne (who was his shopman all last winter) is
     now publishing a spurious paper under the same title in Holborn;
     that they may not be deceived, Mr. Moore's name will be in front of
     every paper he writes. He begs leave further to add, that Brayne
     sold several papers last week in his name, and told those who
     purchased them, that they were wrote by Mr. Moore, and that he
     published for him. In order that the public may not be deceived by
     such low artifice, an affidavit of Brayne's proceedings in this
     respect, will appear in the public papers some time next week."</p>

<p>I have also the papers published by Brayne, which are advertised at the
end to be "Printed and Published by T. Brayne, No. 55., opposite Hatton
Garden, Holborn."</p>

<p>I have referred to No. 4, for Friday, June 3, 1768, addressed to Lord
Mansfield, noticed in the <i>Athenæum</i>; but, with all due respect to the
opinion of the reviewer, I cannot see the slightest similitude to the
style of Junius. It appears to me to be a very feeble performance, and
by a very inferior person. Indeed, the entire series of the
<i>Extraordinary North Briton</i> seems poor and flat when compared with its
predecessor, the original and famous <i>North Briton</i>.</p>

<p>The attempt to show Mason to be Junius is amusing and ingenious; but the
reviewer has evidently failed in persuading himself, and therefore,
amidst the many startling improbabilities by which such an attempt is
encompassed, is scarcely likely to gain many converts to such a theory.</p>

disparaging sense long before the time of the "scholastic doctors and
casuists of the middle ages," as may appear from Persius, v. 115-117.,
where he is showing that an elevation in rank does not necessarily
produce a more elevated tone of mind; and says to an imaginary upstart:</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> "Proverbiales locutiones sunt, Ejusdem Farinæ, Nostræ farinæ,"</p>

<p class="noindent">but makes no allusion to its being a term expressive of baseness and
disparagement. Nor does it seem to be so used by Persius in v. 115. of
his 5th Satire:</p>

illustration of this phrase, I would advert to the practice of declaring
by the bye, which prevailed in the superior courts of common law, before
the Uniformity of Process Act (2 Will. IV., c. 39.). The following
extract from Burton's <i>Exchequer Practice</i>, 1791, vol. i. p. 149., will
sufficiently explain this happily obsolete matter:&mdash;</p>

     <p class="blockquot">"By the old rules it is ordered, 'That upon every defendant's
     appearance, the plaintiff may put in as many declarations as he
     will against every such defendant, provided they all be put in at
     one and the same time.' If there be more than one declaration
     delivered at the same time against the same defendant, every
     additional<span class="pagenum" id="page434">[434]</span> declaration so delivered is called delivering the
     declaration by the bye."</p>

<p>In the King's Bench, in certain cases, any other plaintiff could declare
by the bye against the defendant, and that even before the original
plaintiffs had declared. See Crompton's <i>Practice Common-placed</i>, 2nd
ed., 1783, vol. i. p. 100.</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> English. A bawdrick of a bell clapper.<br />
     Latin. Ropali corrigia.</p>

<p>And the English of "Ropali Corrigia" seems (notwithstanding the English

L. R. N. inquires whether there is any decision subsequent to that in
the reign of Henry VIII. on the claim to the Taylboys barony, respecting
the right of a Commoner marrying a peeress to assume her title and
dignity, he having issue male by her. In reply I beg to inform him that
there appears to have been one on the claim of Richard Bertie, in 1580,
to the Barony of Willoughby, in right of his wife Catherine Duchess of
Suffolk, as tenant by the curtesy, which was rejected, and Peregrine
Bertie her son was admitted in the lifetime of his father. It seems,
however, from the want of modern instances, as also by the elevation of
ladies to the rank of peeresses, with remainders to their children, thus
enabling the issue to sit in the lifetime of the father, that the
prevailing notion is against curtesy in titles of honour. This subject
will be found treated at some length in Cruise's <i>Digest</i>, vol. iii. pp.

 (<a title="Go to Vol. iii., p. 166." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23204/23204-h/23204-h.htm#page166">Vol. iii., p. 166.</a>).&mdash;As the Query of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ANLEY</span>
in No. 70. has not been answered, I beg to say that Vegetating Insects
are not uncommon both in New South Wales and New Zealand. The insect is
the caterpillar of a large brown moth, and in New South Wales is
sometimes found six inches long, buried in the ground, and the plant
above ground about the same length: the top, expanded like a flower, has
a brown velvety texture. In New Zealand the <i>plant</i> is different, being
a single stem from six to ten inches high: its apex, when in a state of
fructification, resembles the club-headed bulrush in miniature. When
newly dug up, and divided longitudinally, the intestinal canal is
distinctly visible, and frequently the hairs, legs, and mandibles.
Vegetation invariably proceeds from the nape of the neck; from
which it may be inferred, that the insect, in crawling to the place
where it inhumes itself, prior to its metamorphosis, while burrowing in
the light vegetable soil, gets some of the minute seeds of the fungus
between the scales of its neck, from which in its sickening state it is
unable to free itself, and which consequently, being nourished by the
warmth and moisture of the insect's body then lying motionless,
vegetates, and not only impedes the process of change in the chrysalis,
but likewise occasions the death of the insect. The New South Wales
specimen is called "Sphæria Innominata," that of New Zealand "Sphæria
Robertsii;" both named, I believe, by Sir W. J. Hooker. In some
specimens of the New Zealand kind now before me, the <i>bodies</i> of the
insects are in their normal state, but the legs, &amp;c., are gone.</p>

<p>Both specimens are figured and described in the <i>Tasmanian Journal</i>,
vol. i. No. 4.</p>

<p class="minor"><i>Prayer at the Healing</i>
 (<a title="Go to Vol. iii., p. 352." href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26899/26899-h/26899-h.htm#page352">Vol. iii., p. 352.</a>).&mdash;N. E. R. inquires whether
this prayer found a place in the prayer-books printed at Oxford or
Cambridge.</p>

<p>I have it before me in the folio Book of Common Prayer, "Oxford, printed
by John Baskett, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, and to
the University, MDCCXV." It is placed between the form of prayer for
Aug. 1. (the King's Accession) and the King's Declaration preceding the
Articles.</p>

<p>This form differs from that given by Sparrow, in his <i>Collection</i>, edit.
1684, p. 165., as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sparrow gives <i>two</i> Gospels: Mark, xvi. 14., St. John, i. 1., the
imposition of the King's hands taking place at the words "<i>they shall
lay</i>," &amp;c. in the reading of the first, and the gold being placed at
reading the words "<i>that light</i>" in the second.</p>

<p>In Baskett's form, the <i>first</i> Gospel only is used, with the collect
"<i>Prevent us, O Lord</i>," before it.</p>

<p>In Baskett's form, the supplicatory versicles and Lord's Prayer, which
agree in their own order with the earlier form, <i>follow</i> this first
Gospel, and <i>precede the imposition and the suspension of the gold</i>,
during which (it is directed) the chaplain that officiates, <i>turning
himself to his Majesty</i>, shall say these words following:</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> "God give a blessing to this work, and grant that these sick
     persons, on whom the king lays his hands, may recover through Jesus
     Christ our Lord."</p>

<p>This does <i>not</i> appear in Sparrow's form of 1684, <i>neither</i> does the
following address, at the close, by the "chaplain, <i>standing with his
face towards them that come to be healed</i>."</p>

    <p class="blockquot"> "The Almighty God, who is a most strong tower to all them that put
     their trust in Him, to whom all things in heaven, in earth, and
     under the earth do bow and obey, be now and evermore your defence,
     and make<span class="pagenum" id="page437">[437]</span> you know and feel that there is none other Name
     under heaven given to man, in whom, and through whom, you may
     receive health and salvation, but only the name of our Lord Jesus
     Christ, Amen."</p>

<p>Objectionable as the ceremony was, there can be no doubt that a much
more Protestant character was given to it by these alterations.</p>

 reference to the initials or letters M. and N. found in the
Catechism and the Marriage Service of our Common Prayer Book, it has
struck me that a fancy of mine may satisfy some of those who wish to
find more than a mere caprice in the selection of them.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in the Catechism we read N. or M., while in the
service for Matrimony M. is for the man, N. for the woman.</p>

<p>I have imagined long ago that "N. or M." may mean "<i>n</i>omen viri; aut
<i>m</i>ulieris:" that M. may stand for "maritus" in the other place, and N.
for "nupta."</p>

    <div class="boxsig"> <p> T<span class="smcap lowercase">YRO</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">TYMOLOGICUS</span>.</p></div>

<p>N. stands (as it constantly did in MS.) for "nomen" or name; M. for N.
N., "nomina" or names. You will observe that in black letter the forms
of N and M are so very similar that by an easy contraction double N
would pass into M, and thus the contracted form N. N. for "nomina" might
have come into M. Corroborating this is the fact that the answer to What
is your name? stands thus: Answer N. or M., and not M. or N.</p>



   <div class="boxsig"> <p> J. F. T.</p></div>

<p>P.S. Throughout the Matrimonial Service I observe M. attached to the
man's name, but N. to the woman's.</p>

 correspondent S. G. asks
the meaning of this phrase? <i>Trenchmore</i> was a very popular dance in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The earliest mention I find of it
occurs in 1564, and the latest in 1728. The figure and the musical notes
may be seen in the fifth and later editions of <i>The Dancing Master</i>. See
also Chappell's <i>National English Airs</i>, vol. ii. p. 181., where some
amusing quotations concerning its popularity are given. <i>Trenchmore</i>
(the meaning of which we have to seek) was, however, more particularly
the name of the <i>dance</i> than the tune. The <i>dance</i>, in fact, was
performed to <i>various</i> tunes. In proof of this I give the following
quotation from Taylor the water-poet's <i>Navy of Land Ships</i>, 1627:</p>

     <p class="blockquot">"Nimble-heel'd mariners (like so many dancers) capring in the
     pompes and vanities of this sinful world, sometimes a Morisco, or
     <i>Trenchmore</i> of forty miles long, to the tune of <i>Dusty my deare</i>,
     <i>Dirty come thou to me</i>, <i>Dun out of the mire</i>, or <i>I waile in woe
     and plunge in paine</i>: all these dances have no other musicke."</p>

 your
correspondent C. H. P. had referred to the <i>Critici Sacri</i>, he would
have found his questions answered. With regard to the quotation from
Acts xvii. 21., I beg to inform him that Drusius makes the same
reference, but generally only, as Pricæus; while Grotius gives the
passages with particular references, in the same manner as Lagnerius. As
to the passage from St. Matthew xiii. 14., he would have found, had he
consulted the <i>Critici Sacri</i>, that Grotius quotes the same passage from
Demosthenes as Pricæus; but, as far as I can see, they are the only
commentators in that work who observed the parallel passages. However,
the fact of its being "employed as an established proverb by Demosthenes
having been generally overlooked," as C. H. P. supposes, is not quite
correct, as it is mentioned in the brief notes in Dr. Burton's <i>Greek
Testament</i>, Oxon., 1831.</p>

 the liberty to inform C.
W. B., for the justification of my countrymen, as well as of his own,
that the <i>Guide to Amsterdam</i> was probably written by a British subject

but as a curiosity of the same sort, an example of French-English to be
found in a book just published by Whittaker and Co., entitled <i>What's

article, p. 69., headed "Qu'êst que, qu'êst que la veritable luxure en
se promenant," and if he can guess at the meaning of the writer, no
foreign-English I ever met with will ever give him trouble.</p>

circumstance omitted by P. C. S. S., in his remarks upon the Duchess of
Buckingham, which explains why <i>a Phipps</i>, on being called to the
peerage, chose the titles of Mulgrave and Normanby.</p>

<p>By her second husband&mdash;the Duke of Buckingham and Normanby&mdash;she had one
son, who succeeded to the title and estates; but, dying unmarried during
his mother's lifetime, <i>bequeathed to her all the Mulgrave and Normanby
property</i>. Her daughter (by her first marriage with James Annesley,

<p class="minor1">Dr. Gregory, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, and
the translator of Reichenbach's <i>Researches on Magnetism</i>, has just
published a volume destined, we believe, to excite considerable
attention, both from the nature of its subject and the position of the
writer. It is entitled <i>Letters to a Candid Inquirer on Animal
Magnetism</i>, and in the first Part, after describing the phenomena, and
their application to medical purposes, and to the explanation of
much that is obscure in what is called Magic or Witchcraft, "a
great part of which appears to have rested on a knowledge of these
phenomena possessed by a few in an ignorant age," Dr Gregory suggests,
not as a fully developed theory, but simply as a conceivable idea, an
explanation of the <i>modus operandi</i> in magnetic phenomena, especially in
clairvoyance. The basis of this explanation is the existence of that
universally diffused power or influence, the existence of which, in Dr.
Gregory's opinion, Reichenbach has demonstrated. The second Part
consists of a large and startling collection of mostly unpublished
cases; and Dr. Gregory expresses his conviction that if the evidence is
fairly studied, it will be impossible to believe that the alleged facts
are the result of imposture or of delusion; or to resist the conviction,
which investigation will confirm, that the essential facts, however
apparently marvellous, are yet true, and have been faithfully reported.
These cases are indeed most extraordinary, and would, at first sight,
seem more fitted to fill our Folk Lore columns than to become the
subject of scientific enquiry; and most readers, we believe, will rise
from their perusal with an inclination to admit that there are more
things true than are dreamt of in their philosophy&mdash;some with an anxious
doubt whether these "arts" are not as "forbidden" as they are "curious."</p>

to receive any amount, more or less, which those who value poetry and
honour Chaucer may be kind enough to remit to them.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
